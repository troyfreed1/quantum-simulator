    "This project shows how to implement a local quantum simulator using only algorithms and Numpy function to simulate what a real quantum simulator would look like. The goal of the project was to create a CLI for our simulator and to be able to run any algorithms as long as they follow our input format specified in our read me. "

    "# Our Algorithm Design\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see all the source code in the simulator.py which has 2 classes: CircuitParser and QuantumSimulator. These two classes work side by side. Our CiruitParser parses our inputs and returns the qubits, gates, and measurements. We then take this data and put it into our QuantumSimulator to actually run the quantum algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "## High level overview:\n",
    "This simulator uses a state-vector model, representing an (n)-qubit system as a complex NumPy array of length (2^n) initialized in (|0\\ldots0\\rangle). Gates are applied by manipulating this vector with vectorized linear algebra and bit operations on integer basis indices, so single- and two-qubit operations act on all amplitudes at once. On top of the ideal evolution, the code can inject simple bit-flip noise after each gate and classical readout errors at measurement time, then estimates outcome probabilities by sampling a fixed number of shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator uses the state vector formalism, representing an n-qubit quantum system as a vector of 2^n complex probability amplitudes. Each amplitude corresponds to a computational basis state, indexed by its binary representation:\n",
    "so, index 0 would be |00..0> with all zeros, index 1 would be |00..01> all the way up to index 2^n-1 |11..1>\n",
    "\n",
    "we initialize here:\n",
    "self.state_vector = np.zeros(self.num_states, dtype=np.complex64)\n",
    "self.state_vector[0] = 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "setting first amplitude to 1, and all others to 0\n",
    "we found np.complex64 reading through some online forums to help with storage when running from our computers\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Evolution\n",
    "### Single-Qubit Gates\n",
    "The naive approach to applying a single-qubit gate would construct a full 2^n × 2^n matrix. This requires O(4^n) memory and O(4^n) time, making it impractical for systems beyond a few qubits.\n",
    "When applying a gate to qubit q, basis states can be grouped into 2^(n-1) pairs that differ only in the q-th bit. Each pair evolves independently under the 2×2 gate matrix, reducing both memory and time complexity to O(2^n).\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### optimize_circuit(gates):\n",
    "Performs a single pass over the gate list and removes adjacent pairs of self-inverse gates (X, H, CNOT on the same qubits) so that `U·U = I` is not simulated twice. Returns a new, shorter gate list and prints how many pairs were removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### QuantumSimulator.**init**(self, num_qubits, noise_prob=0.0, readout_fidelity=1.0, two_qubit_error=None):\n",
    "Allocates a complex state vector of length `2**num_qubits` initialized to the all-zero state, stores single- and two-qubit error rates and readout fidelity, precomputes X and H gate matrices, sets up a PCG64 random number generator, and caches helper data like all basis indices and a binary format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### get_state_vector(self):\n",
    "Returns a copy of the internal state vector so outside code can inspect amplitudes without risking accidental modification of the simulator’s state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### apply_single_qubit_gate(self, gate_matrix, target_qubit):\n",
    "Implements a general 2×2 single-qubit unitary by using bit operations on the cached basis indices to split the state into components where the target bit is 0 vs 1, then updates those amplitudes in place with one vectorized 2×2 matrix multiplication over the whole state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### apply_X_gate(self, target_qubit):\n",
    "Applies a Pauli-X gate to the given qubit by calling `apply_single_qubit_gate` with the precomputed 2×2 X matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### apply_CNOT_gate(self, control_qubit, target_qubit):\n",
    "Implements a CNOT by computing, for every basis index, the control bit via bit shifts and then constructing a new index array where indices with control bit 1 have their target bit flipped using XOR; the state vector is then permuted according to this mapping in one vectorized assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### apply_gate(self, gate):\n",
    "Dispatches a gate dictionary to the appropriate operation: calls `apply_X_gate`, `apply_H_gate`, or `apply_CNOT_gate` based on `gate['type']`, and then calls `apply_bit_flip_noise` on the qubits involved in that gate using the correct error rate (single- or two-qubit).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### measure(self, qubits_to_measure):\n",
    "Computes the probability of each basis state from the state vector (squared magnitude), samples 1000 basis indices according to this distribution, extracts the requested qubits’ bits from each sampled index with bit operations, applies classical readout noise by randomly flipping each bit with probability `1 - readout_fidelity`, and aggregates the results into a dictionary mapping bitstrings to shot counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### measure_all(self):\n",
    "Convenience wrapper that calls `measure` on all qubits from 0 to `num_qubits - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### apply_bit_flip_noise(self, affected_qubits, is_two_qubit=False):\n",
    "Implements a simple bit-flip noise channel by choosing an error probability (single-qubit or two-qubit), then for each affected qubit drawing a random number and, if it is below the error probability, applying an extra X gate on that qubit to model a stochastic flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### print_state(self):\n",
    "Iterates over the state vector and prints the binary label and amplitude for each basis state whose amplitude magnitude is larger than a small threshold, using the cached binary format string for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### run_simulation(circuit_file, noise_mode=False, error_rate=0.0, custom_qubits=None, readout_fidelity=1.0, error_2q=None):\n",
    "High-level driver that parses the circuit, optionally overrides the qubit count, prints a summary, optionally optimizes the gate list in noiseless mode, creates a `QuantumSimulator` with the chosen noise parameters, applies all gates (with optional verbose printing for small circuits), prints the final state, performs measurement if specified, prints a simple histogram of outcomes, and returns the simulator object and measurement results.\n"

    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see from above, we have results from 3 distinct benchmarks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark 1: Runtime vs Number of Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark 1: Runtime vs Number of Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "This benchmark demonstrates the exponential scaling of quantum simulation with respect to the number of qubits. We tested systems from 3 to 30 qubits by applying a Hadamard gate to each qubit and performing 1000 measurement shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exponential State Space Growth**: The number of basis states grows as 2^n, where n is the number of qubits. This means:\n",
    "   - 10 qubits: 1,024 states\n",
    "   - 20 qubits: 1,048,576 states (1,024× larger)\n",
    "   - 30 qubits: 1,073,741,824 states (1,048,576× larger than 10 qubits)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Runtime Scaling**: Runtime increases exponentially with qubits:\n",
    "   - Small systems (3-15 qubits): < 0.01 seconds\n",
    "   - Medium systems (16-20 qubits): 0.01-0.3 seconds\n",
    "   - Large systems (21-25 qubits): 0.5-12 seconds\n",
    "   - Very large systems (26-30 qubits): 27-1365 seconds (~22.8 minutes for 30 qubits)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Memory Requirements**: Memory usage doubles with each additional qubit:\n",
    "   - 25 qubits: 256 MB\n",
    "   - 26 qubits: 512 MB\n",
    "   - 27 qubits: 1 GB\n",
    "   - 28 qubits: 2 GB\n",
    "   - 29 qubits: 4 GB\n",
    "   - 30 qubits: 8 GB\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Limits**: The exponential growth means that each additional qubit approximately doubles both memory and runtime. Going from 29 to 30 qubits increases runtime by ~2× (668.8s → 1365.4s) and memory by 2× (4 GB → 8 GB). This demonstrates why 30 qubits represents a practical limit for state-vector simulation on typical hardware (8GB+ RAM systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential scaling confirms the O(2^n) complexity predicted by theory, making it clear that while our optimizations enable efficient simulation up to 30 qubits, the fundamental exponential barrier limits further scaling without more advanced techniques (such as tensor networks or distributed computing).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark 2: Runtime vs Number of Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we initialized a 10 qubit system and tested it against up 100 gates and we can see that the system increases linearly in time. The amount of data being processed is not nearly as bad as increasing the amount of qubits. With all of our tests finishing in below 1 second. It goes to show that the number of gates does not nearly affect the size or time complexity nearly as badly as the number of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark 3: Test circuit performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Our test circuits all ran in under 0.004 seconds. This is very good and makes sense considering we only had 2 gates and 2 qubits for our bell state circuit and 3 gates and 3 qubits for our ghz circuit test. We can see that our circuit parser and quantum simulator are working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all our simulator is working as intended and the algorithms are able to handle qubits up to 30 qubits due to the sheer size complexity we hit once we surpass that many qubits. Our success in this project is not only from being able to get up to 30 qbits, but how we have been able to continiusly improve from 10 to 15 to 25 all the way to 30."

    "As we can see above the noise caused a bit flip, although we had to exagerate the error prob and We had to run it a handful of times to see this. This is what real quantum noise can look like and the bit flip shows why quantum noise is so important to understand. Now with a normal 1 percent error we won't see bit flips most of the time, which models real quantum hardware. "

    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "All test circuits produce correct results, which match what should happen in theory. Initial testing showed the simulator could handle up to 30 qubits efficiently. However, after implementing critical performance optimizations (vectorized CNOT operations and gate matrix caching), we extended the practical limit to 30 qubits (8GB RAM). This represents a 70-5000x performance improvement depending on circuit composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential increase in state vector size (O(2^n)) remains the fundamental limit, but optimized algorithms make efficient use of each state. For gates, they scale linearly, which means the simulator can handle thousands of gates in reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Noise Modeling**: We modeled noise through taking a random number and checking if it is less than the error probability. If this was the case we would flip the bit through our apply_x_gate function. We also apply a 10x higher error rate to two-qubit gates (CNOT), reflecting real quantum hardware where entangling operations are more error-prone. This effectively simulates what real quantum noise would look like in an actual quantum simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Optimizations**: \n",
    "- Replaced CNOT gate's Python loop with NumPy vectorized bitwise operations (~400-5000x faster)\n",
    "- Cached gate matrices instead of recreating them each application (~2-5x faster)\n",
    "- Result: Simulator now practical for 30 qubit research workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Memory constraint at 30 qubits (requires 8GB RAM for full state vector)\n",
    "- We only support 3 gates at the moment which are X, H, and CNOT which is the base for a quantum simulator but could do with more gate support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The project successfully implements a correct, efficient quantum circuit simulator with both noiseless and noisy modes. The optimizations transformed it from a research prototype to a practical tool. All test circuits produce theoretically correct results, noise modeling faithfully reproduces quantum hardware behavior, and performance scaling follows predicted O(2^n) complexity. This experience taught us how quantum computing works under the hood and the critical importance of algorithmic optimization for classical simulation."
