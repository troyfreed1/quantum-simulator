    "This project shows how to implement a local quantum simulator using only algorithms and Numpy function to simulate what a real quantum simulator would look like. The goal of the project was to create a CLI for our simulator and to be able to run any algorithms as long as they follow our input format specified in our read me. "

    "- apply_H_gate(self, target_qubit): Here we do the same as X gate except with an H gate matrix\n",
    "- apply_CNOT_gate(self, control_qubit, target_qubit): We do essentially create the binary representations of our target_qubit and control_qubit, and then create a new vector state to apply the CNOT gate by directly changing our state_vector indicies instead of using apply_single_qubit_gate as it is more optimal than our 2^n application in the previous gates.\n",
    "- apply_gate(self, gate): Here we get the gate type and then use if statements to apply the gates based on the gate given into the function\n",
    "- measure(self, qubits_to_measure): This simulates the collapse of a quantum state when we measure specific qubits. We do this through 7 steps. Step 1 is to calculate the probabilites for each state and we do this by taking the magnitude of the state vector and sqauring it. Then we perform the measurements in our case it is 1000 shots. We then iterate through each shot and measure the index by taking np.random.choice between the number of states and the probabilites which gives us the measurement_index. After this we convert the index to a binary string, and then extract only the measure qubits. Then we count the results. Thats how we get to our final result which gives us the amount of times each result shows. \n",

The amount of data being processed is not nearly as bad as increasing the amount of qubits. With all of our tests finishing in below 1 second. It goes to show that the number of gates does not nearly affect the size or time complexity nearly as badly as the number of qubits.\n",

Our algorithm is running quite quick and hopefully we can improve this in the future to handle more qubits."

    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "All test circuits produce correct results, which match what should happen in theory. The simulator can handle up to 25 qubits efficiently before it becomes too much for the hardware on our laptops to handle. This is due to the exponential increase of the size complexity for qubits. For gates they scale linearly which means the simulator could handle up to 1000 gates in under 20 seconds, which shows that the gates are not nearly as tough on the hardware as the qubits are. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Noise Modeling**: We modeled noise through taking a random number and checking if it is less than the error probability. If this was the case we would flip the bit through our apply_x_gate function. Effectively simulating what real quantum noise would look like in an actual quantum simulator. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- We ran into memory constraints when it came to the qubit bench mark. \n",
    "- **Frankie will fill out later**\n",
    "- We only support 3 gates at the moment which are X, H, and CNOT which is the base for a quantum simulator but could do with more gate support. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over all the project is implemented to the best of our ability and was really interesting to see how to build a quantum simulator without quantum hardware. This experience taught us how these systems work under the hood and this report outlines how we went about our work. "
